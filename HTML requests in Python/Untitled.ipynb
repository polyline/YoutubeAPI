      "Comment Es muy importante ingeniero que la gente sepa que estas gentes han hecho mal uso de las cosas que no les pertenecen.

      "Comment Now look! someone came up to him and said: “Teacher, what good must I do to gain everlasting life?” 17  He said to him: “Why do you ask me about what is good? One there is who is good. If, though, you want to enter into life, observe the commandments continually.” 18  He said to him: “Which ones?” Jesus said: “You must not murder, you must not commit adultery, you must not steal, you must not bear false witness, 19  honor your father and your mother, and you must love your neighbor as yourself.” 20  The young man said to him: “I have kept all of these; what am I still lacking?” 21  Jesus said to him: “If you want to be perfect,* go sell your belongings and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come be my follower.” 22  When the young man heard this, he went away grieved, for he had many possessions. 23  Then Jesus said to his disciples: “Truly I say to you that it will be difficult for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of the heavens. 24  Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.”<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/nwt/books/matthew/19/\">https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/nwt/books/matthew/19/</a>\n",

      "Comment But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. 2  For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, 3  having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, 4  betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, 5  having an appearance of godliness but proving false to its power;+ and from these turn away. 6  From among these arise men who slyly work their way into households and captivate weak women loaded down with sins, led by various desires, 7  always learning and yet never able to come to an accurate knowledge of truth.<br />8  Now in the way that Janʹnes and Jamʹbres opposed Moses, so these also go on opposing the truth.

I endured these persecutions, and the Lord rescued me from them all. 12  In fact, all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted. 13  But wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled.<br />14  You, however, continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe, knowing from whom you learned them 15  and that from infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 16  All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight,* for disciplining in righteousness, 17  so that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.<br />2 Timothy, Chapter 3<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/nwt/books/2-timothy/\">https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/nwt/books/2-timothy/</a>\n",

      "Comment Wanna kill yourself? Imagine this. You come home from school one day. You’ve had yet another horrible day. You’re just ready to give up. So you go to your room, close the door, and take out that suicide note you’ve written and rewritten over and over and over You take out those razor blades, and cut for the very last time. You grab that bottle of pills and take them all. Laying down, holding the letter to your chest, you close your eyes for the very last time. A few hours later, your little brother knocks on your door to come tell you dinners ready. You don’t answer, so he walks in. All he sees is you laying on your bed, so he thinks you’re asleep. He tells your mom this. Your mom goes to your room to wake you up. She notices something is odd. She grabs the paper in your hand and reads it. Sobbing, she tries to wake you up. She’s screaming your name. Your brother, so confused, runs to go tell Dad that “Mommy is crying nd brother won’t wake up.” Your dad runs to your room. He looks at your mom, crying, holding the letter to her chest, sitting next to your lifeless body. It hits him, what’s going on, and he screams. He screams and throws something at the wall. And then, falling to his knees, he starts to cry. Your mom crawls over to him, and they sit there, holding each other, crying. The next day at college , there’s an announcement. The principal tells everyone about your suicide. It takes a few seconds for it to sink in, and once it does, everyone goes silent. Everyone blames themselves. Your teachers think they were too hard on you. Those mean popular girls, they think of all the things they’ve said to you. That boy that used to tease you and call you names, he can’t help but hate himself for never telling you how good you really are. Your ex girlfriend, the one that you told everything to, that broke up with you.. shee can’t handle it. shee breaks down and starts crying, and blames herself . Your friends? They’re sobbing too, wondering how they could never see that anything was wrong, wishing they could have helped you before it was too late. And your best friend? He’s in shock. He can’t believe it. He knew what you were going through, but he never thought it would get that bad… Bad enough for you to end it. He can’t cry, He can’t feel anything. He stands up, walks out of the classroom, and just sinks to the floor. Shaking, screaming, but no tears coming out. It’s a few days later, at your funeral. The whole town came. Everyone knew you, that boy with the bright smile and bubbly personality. The one that was always there for them, the shoulder to cry on. Lots of people talk about all the good memories they had with you, there were a lot. Everyone’s crying, your little brother still doesn’t know you killed yourself, he’s too young. Your parents just said you died. It hurts him, a lot. You were his big brother , you were supposed to always be there for him. Your best friend, he stays strong through the entire service, but as soon as they start lowering your casket into the ground,he just loses it. He cries and cries and doesn’t stop for days. It’s two years later. Your teachers all quit their job. Those mean girls have eating disorders now. That boy that used to tease you cuts himself. Your ex girlfriend doesn’t know how to love anymore and just sleeps around with boys . Your friends all go into depression. Your best friend? He tried to kill herself. He didn’t succeed like you did, but He tried…your brother? He finally found out the truth about your death. He self harms, he cries at night, he does exactly what you did for years leading up to your suicide. Your parents? Their marriage fell apart. Your dad became a workaholic to distract himself from your death. Your mom got diagnosed with depression and just lays in bed all day. People care. You may not think so, but they do. Your choices don’t just affect you. They affect everyone. Don’t end your life, you have so much to live for. Things can’t get better if you give up. I’m here for absolutely anyone that needs to talk, no matter who you are. Even if we’ve NEVER talked before, I’m here for you. Copy and paste this as your status to show people there are\n",

I’m here for absolutely anyone that needs to talk, no matter who you are. Even if we’ve NEVER talked before, I’m here for you. Copy and paste this as your status to show people there are\n",

      "Comment It looks like Justin Bieber dropped his new album, Purpose: the movement and he isn&#39;t actually in his own videos that he used to be in it. He wouldn&#39;t have even wanted to collaborate with rappers, singers, or electronic musicians such as,  Diplo in Major Lazer and Jack U with Skrillex. <br />Justin Bieber thought, he wanted to make new music video collaborations for the rest of his songs and albums. But I think he made a new single friends which featured, Bloodpop. Now maybe Justin Bieber can collaborate with other guys and men except for girls recently like Halsey, and MO. He&#39;ll be with Shawn Mendes, Troye Sivan, Lukas Graham, Charlie Puth, James Arthur, Ed Sheeran who covers this song,  love yourself; G Eazy, MGK, and One Direction. But he&#39;ll also be with Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, and Camila Cabello from Fifth Harmony. Now, back to the storyline! This song tells about a guy waking up in bed 🛌🛏 and sleeping with his wife. He disturbed her; but she wanted to sleep for a short while. He lapped on her as they both got up and danced to the hallway and into the kitchen. She opened the refridgerator and took out a polystrene container of chicken rice. But the guy looked beside her and control the movement of the woman with his hand moving. At last, he ducked under the fridge door and came up to take the green apple. 🍏 He sat down on the kitchen table  with his wife as she picked up the green apple 🍏 and put it onto another table in the living room where they danced again and put down their handphones. Inside the mobile phones, they danced with each other as she left him behind to another phone and danced one by one. Then, she left again. After that, it&#39;s at the bathroom where they put on their suit to make it look comfortable; but the guy put his hat on and the lady put her phone down as the guy turned on all the lights. She woke up the same thing in bed again as she realized that the guy was gone!; and she noticed something on his pillow. 🛏She picked up the paper and the word read, &quot;love yourself.&quot; She wondered how that guy loved her really much so she put the notified paper down and bumped her head on her pillow and went back asleep without him.\n",

Eminem looked around and said I’m Not Afraid, then Willow Smith began to Wip Her Hair, which started a Far East Movement. They then crashed their G6 into a club and LMFAO finally stopped Party Rocking. Taylor has a Blank Space in her heart and Calvin&#39;s love was so deep for Taylor to fill the Blank Space and Justin jumped in Cold Water for Selena&#39;s Same Old Love. Luckily for Nelly it was all Just a Dream. And Macklemore went to the Thrift Shop in the Summer. Iggy Azalea had a Low Life and looked up while watching a Black Widow lurk into Kiesza&#39;s Hideaway. Rihanna tried to Work but the Naughty Boy kept distracting her by saying La La La. Marshmello wanted only to be Alone as Bruno Mars made The Lazy Song. Maroon 5 finally admits he likes Sugar and OneRepublic admits he was Counting Stars in the Silent Night. Sia tried to break the Chandelier but didn&#39;t know it was made out of Titanuim. Avicii told Katy Perry Wake Me Up so Katy Perry went Roar. Katy Perry came at Juicy J like a Dark Horse and told him this is a Part Of Me. Taylor Swift said she has Bad Blood and Eminem said I will never stop Till I Collapse. Eminem also tried to call Katy Perry on the Payphone  Last Friday Night.
